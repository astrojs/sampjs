<h1>sampjs</h1>

<p><b>sampjs</b> is a small JavaScript library for using the 
SAMP Web Profile from within web pages.
The project is hosted on github at
<a href="http://github.com/astrojs/sampjs/"
   >http://github.com/astrojs/sampjs/</a>.
</p>

<h3>What is SAMP?</h3>

<p>SAMP is the Simple Application Messaging Protocol,
a platform- and language-neutral protocol
used for communicating between applications.
It was developed within the <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/">IVOA</a>
for use with astronomy tools, but the protocol is not specific
to astronomy.
See the <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/SAMP.html"
           >SAMP Standard</a>
and <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/samp">additional material</a>.
</p>

<a name="web-profile">
<h3>What is the Web Profile?</h3>

<p>SAMP is defined in layers, and the <em>Profile</em> layer
defines how tools perform the actual communications.
Two profiles are currently defined: the <em>Standard Profile</em>,
which is suitable for desktop clients, and the <em>Web Profile</em>,
which is suitable for web clients running within a browser
sandbox.
The Web Profile is defined as part of version 1.3 of SAMP;
see
<a href="http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/SAMP/20120411/REC-SAMP-1.3-20120411.html#tth_sEc5"
   >Section 5</a> of the standard for the details.
</p>

<p>For a view of what the protocol looks like in action at the byte level
you can see an <a href="http-log.txt">HTTP log</a> of a short example
session
(generated using "<code>-web:log http</code>" option of the JSAMP hub).
</p>

<p>A talk on SAMP and the Web Profile was presented at ADASS XXI (Paris, 2011).
This will be published as

<h3>What is it good for?</h3>

<p>Putting these things together allows you to write a web page
which can communicate with other desktop applications running on
the same machine as the browser displaying it
(or even with other unrelated web pages in the same browser).
A simple example is a web page with a button you can click to
send an image or table (perhaps generated dynamically by the server)
to a desktop image or table viewer application.
But more complicated scenarios, including two-way communication,
are possible too.
</p>

<p>The technical details of how that can happen and the
associated security implications are
discussed in exhaustive detail in the SAMP standard reference above.
</p>

<a name="hub">
<h3>How can I run SAMP?</h3>

<p>All SAMP communications (Standard and Web) are via a <em>Hub</em>,
a daemon process that brokers messages between clients.
So for SAMP tools to be able to communicate, a Hub must be running.
For web clients, this must be a Web Profile-capable hub,
which currently means
either 
<a href="http://software.astrogrid.org/doc/jsamp/">JSAMP</a> version &gt;=1.3-1
(Java)
or
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sampy/">SAMPy</a> version &gt;=1.2.1
(Python).
There are (at least?) three ways to make this happen:
<ul>
<li>Some SAMP-aware applications, such as
    <a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/">TOPCAT</a> and
    Aladin,
    start a hub automatically when they start up, if one is not already
    present.</li>
<li>You can download and run a JSAMP or SAMPy hub</li>
<li>You can use Java WebStart to start a JSAMP hub by just clicking here:
    <a href="hub/webhub.jnlp">start hub</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How can I write a SAMP-capable web page?</h3>

<p>Use the <a href="http://github.com/astrojs/sampjs/blob/master/samp.js"
                                                                >samp.js</a>
library and write your own code around it.
You can write a minimal SAMP application (often, all that is required)
with very little work.
Usually you will start by importing samp.js (and flXHR.js?
see <a href="#flxhr">the section on flXHR</a>):
<pre>
   &lt;script src="samp.js"/&gt;
   &lt;script src="flXHR.js"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>You can either supply a full path to the js libs or copy them into
the same directory as the web page.
</p>

<p>If you want a more compact version of the samp javascript,
you can use a minifying tool.  One possibility is Google's
<a href="http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/">closure-compiler</a>.
Here is an example invocation using <code>curl</code>:
</p>
<pre>
   curl -dcompilation_level=SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS \
        -doutput_format=text \
        -doutput_info=compiled_code \
        --data-urlencode js_code@/foo/bar/samp.js \
        http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/compile
</pre>

<a name="examples">
<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some working examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="examples/pinger.html">Pinger</a>:
    really really minimal SAMP web page</li>
<li><a href="examples/send.html">Sender</a>:
    very simple script to send a table</li>
<li><a href="examples/navigator.html">Navigator</a>:
    steers (e.g.) Aladin all-sky view using sliders</li>
<li><a href="examples/sendlist.html">Link Broadcaster</a>:
    sends links with only HTML <code>broadcaster.js</code> helper script</li>
<li><a href="examples/pingee.html">Pingee</a>:
    receives a ping message and then unregisters</li>
<li><a href="examples/monitor.html">Client Monitor</a>:
    monitors registered clients with their metadata and subscriptions</li>
<li><a href="examples/tdisplay.html">Table Viewer</a>:
    receives a table from another client and does 2-way communications</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget you need to be running a hub for these to work.
Running other SAMP clients will make it more interesting too -
here is a WebStart link for, e.g.,
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/topcat-lite.jnlp">TOPCAT</a>.

<a name="flxhr"/>
<h3>What is flXHR??</h3>

<p><a href="http://flxhr.flensed.com/">flXHR</a>
is a clever external library for faking a JavaScript
XmlHttpRequest Level 2 object by use of Flash.
</p>

<p>The SAMP Web Profile has to play some tricks to communicate outside
of the browser sandbox.  By preference it uses a W3C standard called
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a> (CORS)
to do this.
However, some browsers do not support CORS, and in these cases it is
(usually) possible to fall back to using a Flash-based workaround.
Since Flash is installed very widely in browsers, that makes sampjs
work almost everywhere 
(see the <a href="#compatibility">compatibility section</a>).
</p>

<p>Sampjs does not implement the Flash magic on its own, that's done
by an external library called <code>flXHR</code>.  This contains
both JavaScript and Flash components.  To get it working
you need to put all the relevant flXHR files in the same directory
as the web client page (or something like that) and import the
flXHR script:
</p>
<pre>
   &lt;script src="flXHR.js"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>flXHR is hosted at
<a href="http://flxhr.flensed.com/">http://flxhr.flensed.com/</a>,
which now redirects to a github site; the project is no longer
actively maintained, since the recommendation is to use javascript instead.
You can grab the library files from there; for convenience you can
find what you need on this site under in the <code>lib/flxhr</code>
directory.
</p>

<p>You don't <em>need</em> to use flXHR with samp.js, but if you don't,
your SAMP client will not run in 
browsers which lack support for CORS
(see the <a href="#compatibility">compatibility section</a>).
Does that matter?  IE6 and Firefox 3.0 are probably pretty unusual by
now, so maybe it's not worth the effort.  You decide.

<a name="contribute">
<h3>Can I contribute?</h3>

<p>Please do!  The sampjs project was originally contributed by 
<a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/">Mark Taylor</a>,
but I'm not a very competent or enthusiastic
JavaScript programmer (or git user), so please improve it
(javascript, documentation, examples, whatever).
The project is hosted on github at
<a href="http://github.com/astrojs/sampjs/"
   >http://github.com/astrojs/sampjs/</a>
If you want write privileges, let me or somebody else know.
If somebody else wants to take over looking after the project,
that suits me too.
</p>

<p>Note that these documentation pages are part of the github project,
on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch
(that's the way that github hosts web pages).
</p>

<p>There is no mailing list specifically for sampjs, but the IVOA
<a href="http://www.ivoa.net/pipermail/apps-samp/">apps-samp@ivoa.net</a>
list may be suitable, or you could try asking Mark
(m.b.taylor@bristol.ac.uk).
</p>

<a name="history">
<h3>History</h3>

<p>This library was originally written by
<a href="http://www.star.bristol.ac.uk/~mbt/">Mark Taylor</a>
as a proof of concept when defining the SAMP Web Profile;
it was not intended for public use.
As is the way of these things, some people used and adapted it anyway.
</p>

<p>It was moved onto the <a href="http://www.astrojs.org/">www.astrojs.org</a>
site in October 2012.
</p>

<p>The original work was supported by Microsoft Research, GAVO and STFC.
